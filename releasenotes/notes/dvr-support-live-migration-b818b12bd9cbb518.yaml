    Fix DVR support for service port live migration.
fixes:
  - Create DVR routers pro-actively on the destination
    node for migrating dvr service port.
  - If the DVR service port has associated floatingip,
    then the floatingip namespace would be created on
    the destination node.
issues:
  - Right now we do not have status update notification
    for L3 networks into Nova for nova to take necessary
    action on failure to create the L3 networks.
    So we do not report back failure and will be handled
    in next release. In this case there might be a delay
    in creating the routers and fip namespace after the
    DVR service port migrates.
  - If the nova reverts or cancels the live migration
    after it informs the neutron and before it migrates
    the dvr service port, then we do not cleanup the router
    and fip namespace that was created on the destination
    node.
